# 🌳 towardTreeEquity

**the towardTreeEquity package is a flexible spatial and statistical scaffold 
that harmonizes foundational datasets and makes them queryable, 
so team members can build their own modular research modules on top of it.**

---

## 🌱 overview

this project lays the foundation for a structured, spatially aware data 
pipeline to support equity-centered urban forestry analytics. it serves 
three core audiences:

- **policy researchers** exploring correlations between canopy cover, 
demographic patterns, and environmental risk
- **municipal planners** verifying and supplementing local tree 
inventories
- **community organizers + citizen scientists** engaging in 
neighborhood-level data storytelling

---

## 🧬 project architecture

this repo supports a multi-phase initiative:

1. **Data Mart Construction**
   - unify municipal tree data, census layers, environmental indices, and 
zoning/flood overlays
   - prepare geospatial joins and block-level summaries

2. **Operational Community Database**
   - format outputs for use by community organizers and citizen-science 
tools

3. **Interactive Dashboard**
   - visualize spatial equity gaps and green infrastructure resilience
   - support ML-driven insights on intervention priorities

## 📦 using the project

this project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for dependency 
management and is organized for modularity and collaboration.
