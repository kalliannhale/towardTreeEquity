field_tagging_version: 1.0

description: >
  Canonical tagging system for all fields used in towardTreeEquity schema layers.
  Tags help classify variables by mathematical type, derivation logic, and modeling utility.
  These tags are used in schema validation, modeling workflows, narrative integration,
  and metadata extraction.

tags:
  measured:
    definition: >
      Fields that represent directly observed or recorded values.
    example_fields:
      - dbh_cm
      - species
      - planting_date
    validation_note: source data must be traceable

  derived:
    definition: >
      Fields computed from other raw inputs using transformation or formulas.
    example_fields:
      - canopy_area_m2
      - distance_to_building
      - estimated_lifespan
    validation_note: must include `derived_from` metadata

  indexed:
    definition: >
      Composite scores generated from multi-dimensional inputs, often normalized.
    example_fields:
      - cooling_index
      - EJ_score
      - UHI_buffer
    validation_note: should reference scoring model and assumptions

  categorical:
    definition: >
      Discrete bins or qualitative categories with finite options.
    example_fields:
      - condition
      - land_use_type
      - native_status
    validation_note: should include valid category list

  temporal:
    definition: >
      Time-specific fields that enable ordering, versioning, or change detection.
    example_fields:
      - last_inspection_date
      - planted_year
      - ingestion_date
    validation_note: standard ISO 8601 format recommended

  spatial:
    definition: >
      Geometries or spatially-derived relationships.
    example_fields:
      - geometry
      - buffer_distance
      - crs
    validation_note: must match schema-level `geometry_type` and `crs`

  latent:
    definition: >
      Inferred fields created through ML or pattern recognition techniques.
    example_fields:
      - vulnerability_cluster_id
      - narrative_summary
      - tree_vector_embedding
    validation_note: must include model version and data source

  economic:
    definition: >
      Financial outputs or estimates tied to ecological services or labor.
    example_fields:
      - cooling_cost_saved
      - maintenance_cost_est
      - stormwater_savings
    validation_note: assumptions must be auditable or referenced

  narrative:
    definition: >
      Storytelling, memory, or community-reported context.
    example_fields:
      - narrative_field
      - memorial_tag
      - contributor_org
    validation_note: requires `narrative_governance` metadata block
